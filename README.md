Philosophy:
In this world there is enough space for everybody. There is everything one needs to be happy, self-develop and fulfill his dreams.
This project is a step towards the society, built on the basis of trust, respect, understanding, help, uniqueness and importance of every person. We are changing the world into a big family, where people live for each other.

Idea: Share what you have, get what you need.

The project is the tool to find somebody who most needs what you want to share, and to find the things you need. No money is required for that. The final decision if to deal with somebody or not, is made on the basis of the past actions by that person and feedback from the other users. This is the way to deal with people on the basis of trust.

What can I share?
Everything!
Everybody has needs.
Somebody needs help with basic things (clothing, food, house...),
somebody – with self-development, education, hobby, art (book, concert ticket, money for a trip, bike, guitar...),
somebody wants to fulfill a project and is looking for resouces (equipment, promotion, place...)

Where to use today?

Charity:
If you want to help the others, and want to know how exactly your help is used – offer it directly to the one who needs it. No middleman is required for that.

You want to fulfill a project but you lack resouces? Try to fundraise here!

If you are in a complex financial situation, there are many people who would be glad to help you with basic material items or money, ask them!

You don't know what to do with the things that are useless for you? They are too got to put them to trash but you don't want to keep them? - Tell the others about such items. Most likely, there is someone who needs it.

If you have dreams but don't have resourses, tell the world about your dream! Probably, yo will inspire somebody to help you. The resources can be actually very close.
